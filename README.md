## Introduction


**nf-core/mycosnp** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for MycoSNP is a portable workflow for performing whole genome sequencing analysis of fungal organisms, including Candida auris. This method prepares the reference, performs quality control, and calls variants using a reference. MycoSNP generates several output files that are compatible with downstream analytic tools, such as those for used for phylogenetic tree-building and gene variant annotations..

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Pipeline summary

### Reference Preparation

> **Prepares a reference FASTA file for BWA alignment and GATK variant calling by masking repeats in the reference and generating the BWA index.**
* Genome repeat identification and masking (`nucmer`)
* BWA index generation (`bwa`)
* FAI and DICT file creation (`Picard`, `Samtools`)

### Sample QC and Processing

> **Prepares samples (paired-end FASTQ files) for GATK variant calling by aligning the samples to a BWA reference index and ensuring that the BAM files are correctly formatted. This step also provides different quality reports for sample evaluation.**

* Combine FASTQ file lanes if they were provided with multiple lanes.
* Filter unpaired reads from FASTQ files (`SeqKit`).
* Down sample FASTQ files to a desired coverage or sampling rate (`SeqTK`).
* Trim reads and assess quality (`FaQCs`).
* Generate a QC report by extracting data from FaQCs report data.
* Align FASTQ reads to a reference (`BWA`).
* Sort BAM files (`SAMTools`).
* Mark and remove duplicates in the BAM file (`Picard`).
* Clean the BAM file (`Picard "CleanSam"`).
* Fix mate information in the BAM file (`Picard "FixMateInformation"`).
* Add read groups to the BAM file (`Picard "AddOrReplaceReadGroups"`).
* Index the BAM file (`SAMTools`).
* [FastQC](#fastqc) - Filtered reads QC.
* Qualimap mapping quality report.
* [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline

### Variant calling and analysis

> **Calls variants and generates a multi-FASTA file and phylogeny.**

* Call variants (`GATK HaplotypeCaller`).
* Combine gVCF files from the HaplotypeCaller into a single VCF (`GATK CombineGVCFs`).
* Call genotypes using the (`GATK GenotypeGVCFs`).
* Filter the variants (`GATK VariantFiltration`) [default (but customizable) filter: 'QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0 || DP < 10'].
* Run a customized VCF filtering script (`Broad Institute`).
* Split the filtered VCF file by sample.
* Select only SNPs from the VCF files (`GATK SelectVariants`).
* Split the VCF file with SNPs by sample.
* Create a multi-fasta file from the VCF SNP positions using a custom script (`Broad`).
* Create a distance matrix file using multi-fasta file(`SNPdists`).
* Create phylogeny from multi-fasta file (`rapidNJ`, `FastTree2`, `quicksnp`, `RaxML(optional)`, `IQTree(optional)`)

### Variant annotation analysis (currently available for *C. auris* B11205 genome only)

* annotated VCF file (`snpEff`)
* combined output report(`SnpEffR`)

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_
3. Requires Python version >3.0

4. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run CDCgov/mycosnp-nf -profile test,YOURPROFILE
    ```

    Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` and are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues, then you can use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, you can use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

5. Start running your own analysis!

    ```console
    nextflow run CDCgov/mycosnp-nf -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv --fasta c_auris.fasta
    ```
6. It is advisable to delete large temporary or log files after the successful completion of the run. It takes a lot of space and may cause issues in future runs.
